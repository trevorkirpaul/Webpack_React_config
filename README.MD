# React Boilerplate using Webpack

I'm creating this as a part of me 'deep-dive' into Webpack.

I've always used CRA for my personal React projects even though I learned how to use Webpack early on. This repo is just a reference to my learning process so I have a base to look at for future projects. It's not exactly a boilerplate in the normal sense.

It definitely won't be on the level of CRA but I did feel the need to get more immersed with Webpack. It's pretty awesome and will definitely come in handy with non React projects.
